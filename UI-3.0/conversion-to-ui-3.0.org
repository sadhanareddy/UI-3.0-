* UI 3.0 Toolkit

* Using UI 3.0 Toolkit

   The UI Toolkit consists of the Virtual Labs User Interface Template
   version 3.0.  The objective of using UI 3.0 Toolkit is to
   standardize the formats of all labs according to the UI 3.0
   Template. The UI 3.0 Toolkit helps you achieve the following:

** How to Identify the Template of your Lab
     
     Before you start using the UI 3.0 Toolkit, you need to understand
     the structure of the lab.

     After conversion, your lab should match the directory structure as
     below. For Example, this is how a lab structure should like
    [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/physical-sciences-iiith  ][physical-sciences-iiith]]
** Details of the files of UI-3.0
   
    - "themes/green-icon" directory has css, images, js, vendors,
      search-result.html folders which are related to UI- 3.0 version.

   - "src/lab" and "src/lab/exp1" directory has index.html, Introduction.html,
      Pre-requisites.html, Feedback.html etc., files which are related to the
      UI-3.0 version.

** How to Convert Unstructured Labs to UI 3.0 Template and Validate the Conversion
    
    Depending on the current structure of your lab, you need to follow
    the steps below to convert your lab to UI 3.0 Template.
  
 -  Take the reference of [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/physical-sciences-iiith][physical-sciences-lab]] of IIITH, which has been
    already converted to UI-3.0.
 
-   Make your lab to the above mentioned structure.
    Copy themes/green-icon folder into the src directory of your lab.
    This hold all the files/folders which are related to UI-3.0 version.

-   Inside the "src/lab" and "src/lab/exp1" add index.html,
    Introduction.html etc., and modify the content of the templates
    accordingly as per your labs content.

-   After making the changes, run the lab to check, whether it has
    been converted to UI-3.0 or not. If you followed the above steps
    properly, you should be able to see your lab in the UI-3.0 format.

** If sources are partially updated/converted to UI-3.0, please do the following to make css work properly.

-  Update the new responsive footer in all the html files (path- "src/lab" ) as
   per New VLABS landing page from the following link:
   "https://github.com/vlead/vlabs-web-pages/blob/master/src/index.html "

-  Go to "
   https://github.com/vlead/vlabs-web-pages/blob/master/src/css/style.css " this
   path and copy the style.css file to the lab repo you are working on, to this
   particular path "css" and remove the old "css/style.css" file.  This is
   because css has been changed.  Like headers, subheaders, logo font size and
   footer has been changed in the Vlabs landing page so, all the pages should be
   made consistent as per the main page.

-  Go to
   "https://github.com/vlead/vlabs-web-pages/tree/master/src/images/social" and
   copy "youtube.png" image to the "images/social" path to the lab repo you are
   working on.
  
-  Create green-icon folder under src/themes directory.

-  Now move css, images, js, vendors folders to the following path
   "src/themes/green-icon".

-  Create index.html file and copy the Introduction.html file content to the
   index.html file.  Note : If the index.html file already exists with the old
   UI content, take a backup of that file as index.html.bak and then create an
   other index.html file.

-  Edit the path inside all the html files in the following path
   "src/lab" and "src/lab/exp1".  Set the path inside the files. In
   the "src/lab" path remove ../../ inside all the files. Inside the
   experiments it should be ../ path should be given wherever it is
   required. This is because makefile is written in a such a way that
   it copies all the lab content and themes content to the build, when
   we run the make. So change the path of the files as per your lab.
 
-  Comment out the search box in all the html files.
   
-  Comment out the previous makefile and  update the makefile as "
   https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/problem-solving-iiith/blob/master/src/makefile
   " .
-  Finally run a make and run the lab in the browser to see all the
   changes, which you have made. Now you should be able to see the lab
   converted to new ui-3.0.
